# Learning_MLP_Chinese_tool_for_kids
I developed this Chinese learning tool for my kids. It essentially took the Chinese characters you are learning as a plain .rtf list and convert them into a CSV with their chinese pronounciations and English meanings. You can then use this list to track your learning progress/ remind yourself/ or export to online flashcard websites such as quizlet.

To use this code, simply download the codes, input all the Chinese characters that you are learning in .rtf. Open up jupyter notebook and let it run. Do remember to change the filename to whatever filename the .rtf file is. You will get a CSV file with the same filename of your rtf file. 

Good luck with learning!

If there are a lot of interest, I will convert this code into a HTML for convenience.
