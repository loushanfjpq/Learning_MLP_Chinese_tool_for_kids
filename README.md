# Learning_MLP_Chinese_tool_for_kids
I developed this Chinese learning tool for my kids. It essentially took the Chinese characters you are learning as a plain .rtf list and convert them into a CSV with their chinese pronounciations and English meanings. You can then use this list to track your learning progress/ remind yourself/ or export to online flashcard websites such as quizlet.
